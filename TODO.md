- [ ] test (--dry-run) option to have deployments.run without effect + allow access to existing deployment : useful for populating data
- [ ] ganache fork when running test against live network
- [x] helpers tx : check num of argument (deploy)
- [ ] support test batteries
- [ ] support generator from (like templates for --export ?)
- [ ] --pendingtx : wait | reset | false | interactive
- [ ] add --deploy option to run task ?
- [ ] library name vs <path>:<name> and error out if ambiguity (when using only name)
- [ ] libraries : address should not need to be address, they could be names of deployments or {address}
- [ ] fix error with proxy constructor, the check use the number of argument given instead of the abi

- [ ] sourcify-upload (https://verification.komputing.org/server)
- [ ] ipfs-upload

- [x] ensure recursive folder for `deploy` folder (up to user to use `test` tags or the folder act as tag ?)
- [ ] exclude tag options
- [x] tests should use tags (by default, it reuse global tag (if present), but option to not reuse global tag)
- [x] builder test option to first run global tag (or use a env variable, ckeck what buidler does with buidler test)
- [x] executeOrDisplay vs execute({skipUnknownSigner})
- [x] use script.id for migrations (throw if return true and no id provided)
- [x] tags for network config =>
      ~~- [ ] network tags can be used in namedAccounts too--~~
